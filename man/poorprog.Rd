\description{
Data frames listing a set of genes
differentially expressed between long surviving (good prognosis)
and short surviving (poor prognosis) cases, their putative targeting
miRNAs, and significantly enriched pathways (FDR < 0.1). Each row
contains a miRNA-gene/gene-pathway pair, a description, expression
correlation (path values), and expression fold-change (node values).
