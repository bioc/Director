\usage{
writeSankey(name = NULL, title = NULL, directory = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name to give file. If no path given, the working directory OR path set in Director will be used. Same name will be given as the title.}

\item{title}{Title of the HTML file produced. The file name is used by default.}

\item{directory}{Absolute path to output directory. If null, the working directory obtained from getwd() will be used. If no absolute path is given (i.e. no "/" is grepped), it will assume a new folder will be created in the working directory.}

\description{
Save sankey figure as a simple HTML file accessible outside of R and shiny. 
Functions initSankey, makeSankey and drawSankey must be performed before this step to ensure a proper figure is saved.

\examples{
Level1 <- createList(poorprog$Level1)
Level2 <- createList(poorprog$Level2)
tempList <- append2List(Level1,Level2)
initSankey() # initializes working directory
tempList2 <- makeSankey(tempList, averagePath=TRUE) # Calculate node and path values
sankey <- drawSankey(tempList2)
writeSankey("temp") # Save figure as the file 'temp.html' in working directory.
