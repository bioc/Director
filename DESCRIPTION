Description: Director is an R package designed to streamline the
        visualization of molecular effects in regulatory cascades. It
        utilizes the R package htmltools and a modified Sankey plugin
        of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and easy,
        browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting
        downstream effects of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules.
        The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged as
        highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need for
        third-party software to view. This enables a straightforward
        approach for scientists to interpret the data produced, and
        bioinformatics developers an alternative means to present
        relevant data.
